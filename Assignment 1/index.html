    <h1>Interactive Essay - Allegory of the Cave</h1>

        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>

        <p>In the allegory of the cave, people are chained inside a dark cave. They can only see shadows on the wall in front of them, which are cast by objects behind them. Right now, they see an abstract shape which can be interpreted in many different ways. The prisoners asrgue over what the shape represents and what it means. These shadows are all they know of the world. It symbolizes how we might mistake illusions for reality. It's a story about discovering truth and gaining knowledge.<span class="clickable" id="first-change"> Seeing the abstract shape rotate, the prisoners may interpret the movement of the abstract shape as shifting or warping, because their only reference for motion is what they've observed within the confines of the cave. In two dimensions, and in two dimensions, it looks like the shape is growing or shrinking at certain parts</span>.</p>

        <p>Nick Sousannis' definition of flatness can be explained like this: Flatness is defined by a limited vision and restricted options. People can't see beyond the systems they're part of, and they help keep those systems going without realizing it. Because of this, the people in the cave only know shadows on the wall.<span class="clickable" id="second-change"> When they see something moving up and down, they think it's falling off the Earth because they don't know anything else and can only understand things based on what they've seen in the cave. Their understanding is limited by their environment</span>.</p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

        <p>There are people outside the cave, who can witness the movement of the shape and understand the role of the 3D objects and light sources. These people have a more comprehensive and dynamic perspective compared to the cave prisoners. They see the object (the abstract shape) and light (sun) causing the shadows, their perspective provides depth and context to their understanding. Their viewpoint resembles a three-dimensional perspective as they know the relation between objects and light in creating the shadows.Since the cave prisoners are limited to a two-dimensional perspective, they are only able to interpret the shadows on the wall without grasping their origins. They lack awareness of the 3D objects and the sunlight casting the shadows, which confines their understanding to a superficial level.

            <span class="clickable" id="third-change">The absract object stops moving, and since the cave prisoners are limited to a two-dimensional perspective, they are only able to interpret the shadows on the wall without grasping their origins. They lack awareness of the 3D objects and the sunlight casting the shadows, which confines their understanding to a superficial level. They do not know that the light source could also be a reason why the object is transforming, or not
            </span>.</p>

        <p> Nick Sousannis’ describes the idea of “Seeing Double” as the ability to look at things from more than one perspective at the same time. It's like having two pairs of eyes that see different things but work together to understand the whole picture. Instead of seeing things in just one way, "seeing double" encourages us to consider multiple viewpoints and ideas simultaneously. Imagine looking at a problem from both sides at once, or understanding a story from different characters' points of view. This way of seeing and thinking helps us break free from narrow thinking and opens us up to new insights and understandings. By embracing "seeing double," we become more flexible thinkers, able to appreciate the complexity and richness of the world around us. Basically, "seeing double" challenges us to go beyond seeing things in black and white, or in this case, two dimensions, or one perspective, and encourages us to explore the many different perspectives of each and every unique situation in this three-dimensional world. It's about being open-minded, curious, and willing to consider different perspectives to gain a greater understanding of the world.
             <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">As the sun sets, the prisoners in the cave still see the abstract shape moving upwards and out of the bounds of the cave they know.</span> Those outside the cave see the sun setting/moving downward, while the shape stays in place. This does not demonstrate the context/perspective of the prisoners. A true perspective, like the one we can see right now, is a demonstration of the shape, the light source and the shadow, which in essence, is seeing double, or all of the possible perspectives in the situation.</p>
